# Thermodynamics-Hot-Meals-Forked

Adds hot meal mechanics to the game.

All food items are separated into realistic categories:

Hot Meals (e.g.: Simple Meals)
Cold Meals (e.g.: Ice Cream from VGP Gourmet)
Hot Drinks (e.g.: Coffee from multiple mods)
Cold Drinks (e.g.: Beer)
Lukewarm Meals (e.g.: Nigiri from VGP Gourmet)
Raw Resources (e.g.: Potatoes)
Nonperishables (e.g.: Packaged Survival Meals)
Edible Raw (e.g.: Agave fruit)

Food will keep track of its temperature, and its heat will gradually diffuse with the surrounding environment.

Each category has an associated ideal temperature. Colonists will be happy to eat food in the right temperature range, and progressively less happy to eat food outside of the ideal range.

Also adds the microwave to heat meals. Regular cooking appliances can also be used.
(And yes, temperature readouts will change based on whether you're set to C or F)
